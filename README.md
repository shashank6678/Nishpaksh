# Nishpaksh
Nishpaksh application is an end-to-end framework for evaluating, comparing, and reporting fairness, risk, and performance characteristics of machine learning models. It supports multiple model types and datasets, computes fairness metrics across protected groups, and generates structured, audit-ready summaries aligned with governance and compliance requirements.

The framework is compliant with the TEC (Technology Evaluation Committee) standard, ensuring systematic documentation of model behavior, limitations, risks, and fairness rationale. It is designed to support transparent decision-making in high-stakes and regulated AI deployments.

The tool was designed and built by Avinash Agarwal(DoT), Dr. Ranitha Prasad(IIIT Delhi) and Shashank Prakash(IIIT Delhi).
